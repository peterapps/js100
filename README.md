# js100
**NEW!** Check out the faster implementation, [em100](https://github.com/peterapps/em100), currently in development.

A web implementation of ase100. View the [live demo here](https://raw.githack.com/peterapps/js100/master/index.html).

This is not actually a port of ase100, but rather an emulator of the E100 built from scratch in JavaScript. The CPU was reverse engineered from the description of the E100 opcodes in [Lab 5](https://grader2.eecs.umich.edu/engr100/lab5/) and the hardware drivers were reverse engineered from the description of the driver protocols in [Lab 7](https://grader2.eecs.umich.edu/engr100/lab7/).
